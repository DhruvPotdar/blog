      <description>I accidentally dropped my keys this morning. They fell and slid down right under the bed. I got down, making sure not to knock anything over, and tried to reach them, but they seemed out of reach. I instinctively looked around to see if I could use anything to reach the keys, and saw an unused guitar-stand nearby. It took me 4-5 seconds to dismantle the stand, and use its rod to retrieve my keys.</description>

      <description>Most of the world&amp;rsquo;s robots are designed for hard, repetitive production work. They perform activities that human beings find complicated, dangerous or tedious. The most common production robot is a robotic arm.
A robotic arm is a device that is programmed to carry out a particular task with extreme accuracy at a rapid pace with great efficiency.
History of the arm The idea of a robot arm is not new. The first robotic arm was designed by Leonardo da Vinci in the late fifteenth century.</description>

      <description>Robots were invented with the goal of helping humans carry out their tasks more comfortably, particularly 4D (Dirty, Dangerous, Difficult, and Dull) tasks. In designing robots, the conventional approach has been to design their hardware and software in accordance with the tasks they are supposed to do. Conventional robots can perform specific tasks accurately, but they are not very versatile and adaptive, and thus applications that are consigned to them rely heavily on their physical structure and controller capabilities.</description>
