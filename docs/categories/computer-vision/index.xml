      <description>I accidentally dropped my keys this morning. They fell and slid down right under the bed. I got down, making sure not to knock anything over, and tried to reach them, but they seemed out of reach. I instinctively looked around to see if I could use anything to reach the keys, and saw an unused guitar-stand nearby. It took me 4-5 seconds to dismantle the stand, and use its rod to retrieve my keys.</description>
