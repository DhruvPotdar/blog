  Over the years, the advancement in robotics and related areas has allowed robot models to have complex and non-linear dynamic equations. The application of such robots involves dynamic environments or environments which are highly inaccessible to humans. Such robot models introduced new challenges in the control strategies as typical industrial controllers such as PID controllers can fail in guaranteeing many features in these areas.</description>

      <description>One of the easiest tasks for us humans to do is move from one place to another without even meticulously planning our way. We get up from our seats and walk to the cafe, get our drink and come back to our seats. During this entire “action” that we performed, we hardly give any thought about the “trajectory” that we have to follow. For example, while walking or running, when we see that there is a banana peel or a pothole in our “path”, we tend to avoid it.</description>

      <description>I accidentally dropped my keys this morning. They fell and slid down right under the bed. I got down, making sure not to knock anything over, and tried to reach them, but they seemed out of reach. I instinctively looked around to see if I could use anything to reach the keys, and saw an unused guitar-stand nearby. It took me 4-5 seconds to dismantle the stand, and use its rod to retrieve my keys.</description>
