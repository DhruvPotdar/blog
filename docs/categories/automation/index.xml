  Over the years, the advancement in robotics and related areas has allowed robot models to have complex and non-linear dynamic equations. The application of such robots involves dynamic environments or environments which are highly inaccessible to humans. Such robot models introduced new challenges in the control strategies as typical industrial controllers such as PID controllers can fail in guaranteeing many features in these areas.</description>

      <description>One of the easiest tasks for us humans to do is move from one place to another without even meticulously planning our way. We get up from our seats and walk to the cafe, get our drink and come back to our seats. During this entire “action” that we performed, we hardly give any thought about the “trajectory” that we have to follow. For example, while walking or running, when we see that there is a banana peel or a pothole in our “path”, we tend to avoid it.</description>

      <description>Robots were invented with the goal of helping humans carry out their tasks more comfortably, particularly 4D (Dirty, Dangerous, Difficult, and Dull) tasks. In designing robots, the conventional approach has been to design their hardware and software in accordance with the tasks they are supposed to do. Conventional robots can perform specific tasks accurately, but they are not very versatile and adaptive, and thus applications that are consigned to them rely heavily on their physical structure and controller capabilities.</description>
