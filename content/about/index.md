The Electronics and Robotics Club (ERC) of BITS Goa is a diverse group of students with interests ranging from electronics to machine learning to mechanical design. Over the years, we have evolved into a platform to learn and experiment with various aspects of science and engineering and to apply them in robotics.

The club includes people who are passionate about the latest technologies and engineering techniques.  This blog is an attempt to share their experience with others in specific fields and also to give people a glimpse of trending areas in robotics research. The posts are written by members with a particular interest in the relevant subject matter and may even correspond to a project that the club has worked upon.

We are open to anyone with a general interest in engineering and who wants to explore robotics, so feel free to get in touch with us.
